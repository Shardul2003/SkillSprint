  <meta content="Software Engineer I (Palo Alto) @ Jerry" name="title"/>
  <meta content="We'd love to hear from you if you like:

 - Making a big impact on Day One with a Forbes Top Startup Employer

 - Working at a startup that has traction ($240M in funding, 40X revenue growth in 4 years)

 - Working with a newer tech stack and building products that have a real impact (Jerry saves the average person $1K a year)

 - Mentorship from talented engineering leaders and peers who have built and scaled companies like Nvidia, Kuaishou, Cepton, and Tiktok

 - Meritocracy: we promote based on performance, not tenure

About the opportunity:

Jerry is building the first AI-powered AllCar™ app to redefine car ownership. The average American spends over 20% of their annual income on their vehicle, yet every part of owning and managing a car is painful – lack of transparency, poor service, high costs, etc. We are simplifying and automating every step of car ownership, all streamlined on our mobile app. We started with insurance shopping in 2019, since then we’ve launched loan refinancing, real-time driving insights, car diagnostics, a repair marketplace, and a GPT-4 chatbot. Our engineering team isn’t just focused on making something that works, we want to make something that works exceptionally well. If you want to contribute to something that matters and is actively making car ownership easier, simpler, and more accessible for 5M+ people, join us!

We are looking for entry-level software engineers in the Toronto area to join our engineering team! We are in growth mode and have aggressive goals to scale our technology and our business in the next few years as we go from 5M to 50M users. We don't require any specific work experience but we are looking for the following characteristics: passion for learning, hustle, and ownership. The pace of learning at a startup like Jerry is unbeatable. You can expect your scope of responsibilities to grow quickly if you excel in your role and demonstrate a willingness to keep learning and growing. If you’re looking for an opportunity to accelerate your career, we are hiring across multiple engineering teams!

Our tech stack:

 - Hosting infra: AWS

 - React for web frontend

 - NodeJS + Typescript for backend development

 - React (mobile app is written in React Native) 

 - Redis, Postgres, DynamoDB for backend storage

 - Python for data pipeline and ML

 - Clickhouse for data warehouse

 - Python + Go for infrastructure as code and continuous integration

What we are looking for:

 - Bachelor's degree in computer science or engineering

 - Any internship, co-op, or summer work experience is an asset

Jerry is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. We prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, reproductive health decisions or related medical conditions, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other characteristics protected by applicable local, state or federal laws.

Jerry is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities in our job application process. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please contact us at recruiting@getjerry.com

About Jerry:

Jerry is America’s first and only AllCar™ app. We are redefining and radically improving how people manage owning a car, one of their most expensive and time-consuming assets. 

Backed by artificial intelligence and machine learning, Jerry simplifies and automates owning and maintaining a car while providing personalized services for all car owners' needs. We spend every day innovating and improving our AI-powered app to provide the best possible experience for our customers. From car insurance and financing to maintenance and safety, Jerry does it all.

We are the #1 rated and most downloaded app in our category with a 4.7 star rating in the App Store. We have more than 5 million customers — and we’re just getting started. 

Jerry was founded in 2017 by serial entrepreneurs and has raised more than $242 million in financing.

Join our team and work with passionate, curious and egoless people who love solving real-world problems. Help us build a revolutionary product that’s disrupting a massive market." name="description"/>
